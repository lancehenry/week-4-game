# week-4-game

## Description
This is the week 4 assignment using the skills we've learned up to this point. On each page load, a random number is generated between 19 - 120 and each of the four crystals are given a random value between 1 - 12. The user clicks the crystals to try and equal the random number. If they're successful, an alert pops up saying "You're a winner!" and the game resets. If they're unsuccessful, an alert pops up saying "You're a loser." and the game resets.

## How it was built
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery
